# Functions
Rust uses "snake_case" as the conventional style for function and variable
names. In this all letters are lower case and underscores seperate words.

A function in rust can be defined as such:

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i64) {
    println!("The value of argument is: {x}");
}
```

1. The variable named `x` in the function definition is called parameter.
2. The type of all parameters in the function definition have to be annotated in
   Rust.
3. The value passed in the function call, is called the argument passed to the
   function.
4. Functions optionally end with an expression.

# Statements and Expressions
Rust is an expression-based language.  
1. **Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a
   value.  
2. **Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value.

For example, `let y = 6;` is a statement. Function definitions are also a statement.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

This entire `main` function is a statement in itself.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you cannot assign a `let` statement
to another variable, as something like this `let x = (let y = 6);`. The `let y = 6 ;`
statement doesn't return a value, so there isn't anything for `x` to bind to.

You cannot write `x = y = 6;` either, because `y = 6` doesn't return anything.
